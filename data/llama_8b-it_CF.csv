The term came about to refer to beautiful but trfling whorish women who only cling to men who they thought were going to be rich and famous-a man they can use to acquire wealth. Later on, almost everyone in the south adopted the term to refer to anyone who they have a distaste for or a person who they felt like was being shisty in their dealings with them. The phrase simply means that the shisty person who is bothering them needs to get away from them and stay away until they can be honest and trustworthy. Today the phrase is widespread and use of the phrase has surpassed the South. Children of the Cornbread has a song called ""Get on Down"" but it is not relating to the meaning of this phrase.
